# Test/Behavioural Driven Development (TDD/BDD) using Jest

# This project create fully tested simple functions to perform the following operations using Jest Framework.

- Add two numbers.
- Add an indefinite amount of numbers.
- Takes two numbers as argument and return the difference between the numbers.
- Multiply an indefinite amount of arguments.
- Takes two numbers as arguments and returns the first number divided by the second number.
- Takes a username as an argument and makes a call to GitHub API and returns all the repositories owned by the user as an array. This was achieved by using axios framework to implement and mock the asynchronous task.
- Takes two strings as arguments and return the concatenation of the two strings.

# NOTE: My tests accounted for all possible edge cases. Also, made sure that all tests are failing before actual implementation.
